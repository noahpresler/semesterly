# Hack Sessions and Check-ins


## Week.ly Check-in ~ 10 minutes

The check-in is just a time for you to notify us of your progress or anything that’s stopping you from making progress. It’s expected that you are active on the team Slack during this time (no Zoom unless you need to talk about something). All you have to write or tell us about is:



1. What you’ve done so far
2. What you will do next
3. What’s blocking you


## Week.ly Hack Session ~ 30-90+ minutes

Every Thursday at 4pm, we’ll meet in Malone to discuss our progress and next steps. In-person is preferred but virtual is permitted.
