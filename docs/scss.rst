.. note:: Although we write SCSS, you'll notice we use the SassLint tool and Sassloader.  SASS is an older version of SCSS and SCSS still uses the old SASS compiler.  Please don't write SASS, we're a SCSS shop.  `You can read about it briefly here. <https://stackoverflow.com/questions/5654447/whats-the-difference-between-scss-and-sass/>`_

What's in SCSS, What's not?
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Written in SCSS:

    1. Web Application

Written in plain CSS:

    1. Splash pages
    2. Pages for SEO
    3. Emails and unsubscribe pages
    4. basically everything that is not the web app

File Structure
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

All of our SCSS is in ``static/css/timetable`` and is broken down into 5 folders.  The ``main.scss`` ties all the other SCSS files together importing them in the correct order.

========== =====================================================================
Folder     Use
========== =====================================================================
Base       ``colors.scss`` and ``fonts.scss``
Vendors    any scss that came from a package that we wanted to customize heavily
Framework  ``grid.scss`` and ``page_layout.scss``
Modules    styles for modular parts of our UI
Partials   component specific styles
========== =====================================================================

All of the other CSS files in the ``static/css`` folder is either used for various purposes outlined above.

Linting and Codestyle

We use SASSLint with Airbnb's ``.scss-lint.yml`` file converted into ``.sass-lint.yml``.  Some things to take note of are

    1. All colors must be declared as variables in ``colors.scss``.  Try your best to use the existing colors in that file
    2. Double quotes
    3. Keep nesting below 3 levels, use BEM
    4. Use shortened property values when possible, i.e. ``margin: 0 3px`` instead of ``margin: 0 3px 0 3px``
    5. If a property is ``0`` don't specify units

Refer to our ``.sass-lint.yml`` for more details and if you're using intelliJ or some IDE, use the sass-lint module to highlight code-style errors/warnings as you code.
