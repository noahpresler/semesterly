Learning The Stack
==================

.. note:: 
  
    Learning a new thing can be scary, especially when all you have are some docs and a 
    massive code base to learn from. That's why we are here to help you learn, build, 
    and contribute. Ask us questions at our `Discord <https://discord.gg/txYbphsAV7>`_!

Tutorials and Resources

Learning the Backend
####################

**Django** is a Python Web framework that provides a huge number of tools for web
developers to quickly write scalable code with minimal configuration. It is used all
over the tech industry by companies like Spotify, Instagram, YouTube, and DropBox!

`Writing your first Django app
<https://docs.djangoproject.com/en/3.2/intro/tutorial01/>`_ is the official Django
tutorial. It is top notch! The official documentation can be found at the same url and
provides high quality information about how to build with this modern web framework. For
example, here's the documentation on `making queries with Django
<https://docs.djangoproject.com/en/3.2/topics/db/queries/>`_.


Learning React/Redux
####################

React is a Javascript library created by Facebook for building user interfaces. It
allows developers to make encapsulated components that can be written once and used
anywhere. 

Redux is state container that makes React development easier to manage long term! 

The official docs are the go-to: `React Basics
<https://reactjs.org/docs/hello-world.html>`_, `React Hooks
<https://reactjs.org/docs/hooks-intro.html>`_, `Redux & Redux Toolkit
<https://redux.js.org/tutorials/index>`_, and `TypeScript
<https://www.typescriptlang.org/docs/>`_. We suggest going through the step-by-step
React tutorial rather than the practical tutorial because the practical tutorial is done
with class-based components, but we prefer functional components.

If you're looking for something more structured, one suggestion is this `Udemy
course <https://www.udemy.com/course/react-the-complete-guide-incl-redux/>`_, which
covers functional React, Redux concepts, TypeScript, and more.

Ultimately, the best practice will be to create a small project using ``npx
create-react-app my-app --template redux-typescript`` and going from there. You will
become much more familiar with all of the concepts when you try to work through it
yourself.

Learning CSS/SCSS
#################

The most important step is to `learn the CSS basics <https://www.w3schools.com/css/>`_.

With that, you can `dive into SCSS <http://sass-lang.com/guide>`_, a css preprocesor.

For development, we use the BEM methedology (`learn about BEM here!
<http://getbem.com/introduction/>`_) and the `Airbnb style guide
<https://github.com/airbnb/css>`_.
