Tutorials and Resources
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Learning the Backend
####################

**Django** is a Python Web framework that provides a huge number of tools for web developers to quickly write scalable code with minimal configuration. It is used all over the tech industry by companies like Spotify, Instagram, YouTube, and DropBox!

`Writing your first Django app <https://docs.djangoproject.com/en/1.11/intro/tutorial01/>`_ is the official Django tutorial. It is top notch! The official documentation can be found at the same url and provides high quality information about how to build with this modern web framework.

Learning React/Redux
####################

React is a Javascript library created by Facebook for "building user interfaces". It allows developers to make encapsulated components that can be written once and used anywhere. 

Redux is state container that makes React development easier to manage long term! 

If you're a beginner, `we've created a React tutorial <https://github.com/noahpresler/React-Tutorial>`_ that will teach you the basics of developing a React app all via codepen. This is a great way to get started! 

We highly recommend continuing with React via `EggHead's React Fundamentals video <https://egghead.io/courses/react-fundamentals>`_ which teaches you everything you'll need to know.

Finally, finish off with `EggHead's Redux tutorial <https://egghead.io/courses/getting-started-with-redux>`_. You'll be a pro after that! 

Learning CSS/SCSS
#################

The most important step is to `learn the CSS basics <https://www.w3schools.com/css/>`_.

With that, you can `dive into SCSS <http://sass-lang.com/guide>`_, a css preprocesor.

For development, we use the BEM methedology (`learn about BEM here!  <http://getbem.com/introduction/>`_) and the `Airbnb style guide <https://github.com/airbnb/css>`_. 

Learning Scraping/Parsing
#########################

Here's one `insightful article <https://codeburst.io/making-a-web-scraping-application-with-python-celery-and-django-23162397c0b6>`_.
And here's another `article <https://realpython.com/beautiful-soup-web-scraper-python/>`_!
