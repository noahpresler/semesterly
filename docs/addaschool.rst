Add a School
*************

Adding a new school is easy and can be done in a few simple steps:
    1. `Edit the Configuration Files`_
    2. `Develop a Parser`_
    3. `Test and Merge`_

Edit the Configuration Files
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
Create the folder, etc.

Develop a Parser
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

.. note:: If your school uses one of the systems: Ellucian or Peoplesoft, you may be able to use our generalized infrastructure built to parse these systems with very minimal configuration. Before starting, check :ref:`genparsers`.

In the folder you created, create a new file called `yourschoolacronym_courses.py`. This will be the home of your parser.

Test and Merge
