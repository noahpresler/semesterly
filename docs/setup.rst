Installation
=============

This guide will bring you through the steps of creating a local Semester.ly server and development environment. It will walk through the setup of the core ecosystems we work within: Django/Python and React/Node/JS. It will additionally require the setup of a PostgreSQL database.

Fork/Clone The Repository
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
Forking Semester.ly will create your own version of Semester.ly listed on your GitHub!
Cloning your Semester.ly fork will create a directory with all of the code required to run your own local development server. Navigate to the directory you wish to work from, then execute:

1. **Fork** navigate to our `GitHub repository <https://github.com/noahpresler/semesterly>`_ then, in the top-right corner of the page, click Fork.

2. **Clone** by executing this line on the command line:

    .. note:: **ATTENTION:** Be sure to replace [YOUR-USERNAME] with your own git username

    .. code-block:: bash

         git clone https://github.com/[YOUR-USERNAME]/semesterly

Option 1: Set up using Docker
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
Steps are below on getting your local development environment running:

1. **Download and install docker** for your environment (Windows/Mac/Linux are supporter)

    https://www.docker.com/get-started

2. Create **semesterly/local_settings.py** as follows:

    .. code-block:: bash

        DEBUG = True

        TEMPLATE_DEBUG = DEBUG

        DATABASES = {
            'default': {
                'ENGINE': 'django.db.backends.postgresql_psycopg2',
                'NAME': 'postgres',
                'USER': 'postgres',
                'PASSWORD': '',
                'HOST': 'db',
                'PORT': '5432',
            }
        }

    .. note:: **ATTENTION:** When you clone the repo, you get a folder called semesterly and inside there is another folder called semesterly. Put this in the second semesterly folder.

3. Edit **semesterly/dev_credentials.py** and add a value for JHU_API_KEY in single quotes like below.
    You can request this API KEY from http://sis.jhu.edu/api.

    .. code-block:: bash

        'JHU_API_KEY': 'xxxxxxxx',

    .. note:: **ATTENTION:** This is also in the second semesterly directory.

    Now run this command in your terminal to make sure that this file isn't tracked by Git and your API key stays local to you.

    .. code-block:: bash

        git update-index --skip-worktree semesterly/dev_credentials.py


3. Add this entry to your hosts file as follows (This file is in c:\Windows\System32\drivers\etc\hosts or /etc/hosts)

    .. code-block:: bash

        127.0.0.1       sem.ly jhu.sem.ly

    .. note:: **ATTENTION:** If you're working on other schools, add their URLs here as well (i.e. uoft.sem.ly for University of Toronto).

4. Launch terminal or a command window and run:

    .. code-block:: bash

        docker-compose build

        docker-compose up

    The **build** command creates a local Database and build of your source code.
    The **up** command runs everything. Be careful not to build when you don't need to as this will destroy your entire database and you'll need to ingest/digest again to get your course data (which takes about 30 minutes).

    You now have Semester.ly running. If this is the first time, you will want some data which done in the next step.

5. Getting JHU data for a given term. In a new terminal run the following

    .. code-block:: bash

        docker exec -it $(docker ps -q -f ancestor=semesterly) /bin/bash
        * OR if that doesn't work
        docker exec -it $(docker ps -q -f ancestor=semesterly) shell

    This will put you inside of the shell. Now you can get courses by running these commands:

    .. code-block:: bash

        python manage.py ingest jhu --term Spring --years 2018

        python manage.py digest jhu

6.  Open a browser and visit http://jhu.sem.ly:8000 and hack away.

        You can skip ahead to **Advanced Configuration** or **How it All Works** now.

Option 2: Setup using a Python Virtual Environment
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
Make sure you have installed Python 2.7. If you have not you can `follow this <https://wiki.python.org/moin/BeginnersGuide/Download>`_. Please also download the python installer, `PIP (install guide) <https://pip.pypa.io/en/stable/installing/>`_. We will now install and setup a python virtual environment. This keeps your dependencies for other projects and classes seperate from those required for Semester.ly.

Install virtualenv:

.. code-block:: bash

    sudo pip install virtualenv

Create a virtual environment called ``venv``:

.. code-block:: bash

    virtualenv -p /usr/bin/python2.7 venv

To enter your virtual environment, execute the following code from your Semesterly directory:

.. code-block:: bash

    source venv/bin/activate

.. note:: Be sure to execute the above "source" command anytime you are working on Semesterly!

Check your OS info
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
If you're on a posix OS (Mac, Ubuntu, Fedora, CentOS, etc.) this is how you check what version of OS you're on.

.. code-block:: bash

    uname -n

Install PostgreSQL
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
Before installing the python requirements, you must make sure to have PostgreSQL setup on your device.

**On mac**, `install Homebrew <http://brew.sh/>`_ and run:

.. code-block:: bash

    brew install postgres
    pg_ctl -D /usr/local/var/postgres start && brew services start postgresql

**On Ubuntu 14.x.x** use apt-get:

.. code-block:: bash

    sudo apt-get install postgresql python-psycopg2 libpq-dev libxslt-dev libxml2-dev

**On Ubuntu 16.x.x** use apt:

.. code-block:: bash

    sudo apt install postgresql python-psycopg2 libpq-dev libxslt-dev libxml2-dev

**On CentOS / Fedora** use yum:

.. code-block:: bash

    sudo yum install postgresql gcc python-lxml postgresql-libs libxslt-devel libxml2-devel

Install Python Requirements
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

.. note:: **ATTENTION MAC USERS:** you must install the xcode command line tools via ``xcode-select --install`` before proceeding. You may also need to update openssl. If so, please `follow this guide <https://medium.com/@katopz/how-to-upgrade-openssl-8d005554401>`_.

All python dependencies are kept in a file called ``requirements.txt``. Anytime a dependency is added or changed, we update it in this file. To bring your virutal environment up to date with all of these requirements easily, simply execute:

.. code-block:: bash

    pip install --upgrade pip
    pip install -r requirements.txt

There are python modules that are missing from requirements.txt. Install them with:

.. code-block:: bash

    pip install pyyaml pygments kombu==3.0.33 billiard

Install Node Packages
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
Node and node package manager are the backbone of our frontend setup. To begin, install Node Package Manager (npm).

**On mac**:

.. code-block:: bash

    brew install node

**On Ubuntu 14.x.x**:

.. code-block:: bash

    wget -qO- https://deb.nodesource.com/setup_6.x | sudo bash -
    sudo apt-get install nodejs
    sudo apt-get install npm

**On Ubuntu 16.x.x**:

.. code-block:: bash

    wget -qO- https://deb.nodesource.com/setup_6.x | sudo bash -
    sudo apt install nodejs
    sudo apt install npm

**On CentOS / Fedora**:

.. code-block:: bash

    sudo yum install -y gcc-c++ make
    curl -sL https://rpm.nodesource.com/setup_6.x | sudo -E bash -
    sudo yum install nodejs

Then use the newly installed Node Package Manager (npm) to install all javascript dependencies. When you execute this command, it reads from the file ``package.json`` which specifies all dependencies, their versions, and some additional node related configurations:

.. code-block:: bash

    sudo npm install
