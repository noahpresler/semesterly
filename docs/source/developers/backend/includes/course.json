    operating systems theory and practice. Topics include processor
    management, storage management, concurrency control, multi-programming and
    processing, device drivers, operating system components (e.g., file
    system, kernel), modeling and performance measurement, protection and
    security, and recent innovations in operating system structure. Course
    work includes the implementation of operating systems techniques and
    routines, and critical parts of a small but functional operating system."],

    Unix Systems Programming is helpful as well.)", "Participants must be
    familiar with the UNIX environment and must be fluent in the C
    programming language. The course includes significant programming
    projects; without prior development experience you'll probably get lost
    in a maze of low-level code."],
