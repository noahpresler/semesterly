Installing your doc directory
=============================

You may already have sphinx `sphinx <http://sphinx.pocoo.org/>`_
installed -- you can check by doing::

  python -c 'import sphinx'

If that fails grab the latest version of and install it with::

  > sudo easy_install -U Sphinx

Now you are ready to build a template for your docs, using
sphinx-quickstart::

  > sphinx-quickstart

accepting most of the defaults.  I choose "sampledoc" as the name of my
project.  cd into your new directory and check the contents::

  home:~/tmp/sampledoc> ls
  Makefile  _static   conf.py
  _build    _templates  index.rst

The index.rst is the master ReST for your project, but before adding
anything, let's see if we can build some html::

  make html

If you now point your browser to :file:`_build/html/index.html`, you
should see a basic sphinx site.

.. _fetching-the-data:

Fetching the data
-----------------

Now we will start to customize out docs.  Grab a couple of files from
the `web site <https://github.com/matplotlib/sampledoc>`_
or git.  You will need :file:`getting_started.rst` and
:file:`_static/basic_screenshot.png`.  All of the files live in the
"completed" version of this tutorial, but since this is a tutorial,
we'll just grab them one at a time, so you can learn what needs to be
changed where.  Since we have more files to come, I'm going to grab
the whole git directory and just copy the files I need over for now.
First, I'll cd up back into the directory containing my project, check
out the "finished" product from git, and then copy in just the files I
need into my :file:`sampledoc` directory::

  home:~/tmp/sampledoc> pwd
  /Users/jdhunter/tmp/sampledoc
  home:~/tmp/sampledoc> cd ..
  home:~/tmp> git clone https://github.com/matplotlib/sampledoc.git tutorial
  Cloning into 'tutorial'...
  remote: Counting objects: 87, done.
  remote: Compressing objects: 100% (43/43), done.
  remote: Total 87 (delta 45), reused 83 (delta 41)
  Unpacking objects: 100% (87/87), done.
  Checking connectivity... done
  home:~/tmp> cp tutorial/getting_started.rst sampledoc/
  home:~/tmp> cp tutorial/_static/basic_screenshot.png sampledoc/_static/

The last step is to modify :file:`index.rst` to include the
:file:`getting_started.rst` file (be careful with the indentation, the
"g" in "getting_started" should line up with the ':' in ``:maxdepth``::

  Contents:

  .. toctree::
     :maxdepth: 2

     getting_started.rst

and then rebuild the docs::

  cd sampledoc
  make html


When you reload the page by refreshing your browser pointing to
:file:`_build/html/index.html`, you should see a link to the
"Getting Started" docs, and in there this page with the screenshot.
`Voila!`

Note we used the image directive to include to the screenshot above
with::

  .. image:: _static/basic_screenshot.png


Next we'll customize the look and feel of our site to give it a logo,
some custom css, and update the navigation panels to look more like
the `sphinx <http://sphinx.pocoo.org/>`_ site itself -- see
:ref:`custom_look`.
