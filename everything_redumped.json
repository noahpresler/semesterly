But if marketing is to be an agent of strategy then it must recognize that businesses following different strategies require different kinds of marketing efforts and different supporting marketing infrastructures and approaches. Similarly, just as businesses change their strategies at different stages of their lifecycle and in response to market and competitive dynamics, so too must marketing make the appropriate accommodations to maintain its compatibility with the business' overall direction.
