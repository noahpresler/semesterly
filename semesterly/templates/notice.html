<p>Dear Semester.ly user,</p>
<p class="indent">Our goal has always been to make course registration easier. We believe that you deserve speed, ease, convenience, and beautiful design in everything you touch. From finding the courses that are right for you to registering for them on the University system, we aim to improve every aspect of course registration. That is why we are excited to announce that we are partnering with Johns Hopkins University’s IT department to provide more reliable service, scalability, and integration with the university system!</p>
<p class="indent">We tested out this partnership with last semesters’ “Add to SIS Cart” button and will be building on that success to launch features that you have been asking for: course pre-requirement checking, recommended courses based on your major, and so much more!  As part of this partnership, starting March 8th, 2019, Semester.ly will be hosted by HopkinsIT.</p>
<p class="indent">This means that HopkinsIT will be helping us improve the reliability of Semester.ly, but it also means user data will be hosted on their network. Only Semester.ly team members will be able to access user data but we still think this is a change you should be aware of. We believe that you should have control of your personal data and with that in mind, we would like to give you the option to delete your account. On the account dropdown, there is now a Delete Account button if you so choose. <a href="https://jhu.semester.ly/delete_account">Here</a> is a direct link. After careful consideration, we have decided that this move will help take Semester.ly to the next level and hope that you will join us on this new journey!
</p>
<p>
Sincerely,<br>
The Semester.ly Team
