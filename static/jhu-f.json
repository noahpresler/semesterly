Do charter schools increase student achievement and, if so, what types of students respond most? Cause and effect questions like these are crucial to developing evidence-based practice in business, nonprofits and the government. Yet answering these questions is difficult when a new idea is not implemented with the explicit intent of measuring its impacts. This class aims to teach students how to develop empirical evidence about the best ways to achieve their aims, whether these aims are to increase profits or to address social problems. The use of randomized controlled trials to test program impacts is becoming increasingly popular in businesses and government. An employee estimated that the average Facebook user is a participant in about 10 randomized controlled trials at any point in time. The U.S. government recently created a “Nudge Squad” that works with federal agencies to test new ideas through randomized controlled field trials. Experiments are an integral part of the ‘big data’ revolution going on in business, nonprofits and government. Importantly, they do not require advanced statistics or powerful computers to implement and interpret. The course will blend lectures, group discussions, readings, homework, a group project, and guest speakers from private industry, nonprofits and government agencies. I am a firm believer that the most fundamental principles can be stated in plain English. Thus the course stresses intuition (in English) over math and mechanics.

Students examine the strategic concepts and tools that guide market selection, the development of a customer value proposition, and successful competitive differentiation in contemporary business markets. They also study how this strategic analysis serves as the integrating theme for creating a firm’s B2B marketing programs and managing strategic customers as assets. A mixture of lectures, discussions, cases, and readings are used to examine how product and service decisions are designed to deliver the B2B value proposition, how pricing captures customer value, how value is communicated to and among customers, and how marketing channels are used to make this value accessible to target customers. Students will compare and contrast how the strategic and tactical processes of developing and managing value-generating relationships differ between B2B and B2C markets.",

This course investigates the role of the illustrated book within the political, religious, and artistic developments that took place after the rise of Christianity from the end of the Roman Empire until the early modern period in the medieval West and in Byzantium, permeating Jewish and Islamic traditions. We will examine how the different types of books, such as horizontal and vertical scrolls, large and miniature size codices influenced the placement, conception, and style of the illustrations. The course also addresses processes of manufacture, issues of materiality (i.e. precious multi-media book covers, papyrus, parchment, paper), and the relationship between text and image.

    "description" : "Connectionism is an approach to Artificial Intelligence computation inspired by how the brain, a network of neurons, works. A connectionist model (or artificial neural network) is a collection of simple processing units that are massively interconnected with each other, and that represents knowledge in its connection pattern. Each processing unit has highly limited computational power but the collection of units as a whole has great computational power (as strong as the Turing machine). Connectionist models have been used to study diverse aspects of human cognition: attention, pattern recognition, memory, categorization, language processing, learning, and decision making. In this seminar, students will learn important concepts, principles, algorithms, and practical skills in connectionist modeling by actually doing connectionist modeling. Students will first play with toy problems to learn various types of connectionist modeling techniques, and will then carry out a team research project. In addition to practical skills, students will learn to be explicit about their assumptions and reasoning when making their (conceptual or implemented) models and to make new observable predictions that can be tested in experiments.Recommended Course Background: Experience with some programming language.

Who gets the chance to do it? And what happens when people find themselves doing work that isn’t worth doing? In this course we will consider the meaning and consequences of work, from the heroic to the tragic, through a selection of American literature from the last days of slavery to the present.

    "description" : "This course undertakes an in-depth study of what is arguably the greatest long poem in the English tradition, John Milton's Paradise Lost. The poem, first published in 1667, is Milton's take on the Judeo-Christian story of the Fall found in the Bible. Paradise Lost does not merely re-tell the biblical account, however. By expanding three chapters of Genesis into a twelve-book epic meant to rival its classical forbears—most importantly Virgil's Aeneid—Milton's poem makes room for new readings of an old story. This course encourages students to find their own new readings of the Genesis story by considering the historical contexts of the poem's production as well as the conversations Paradise Lost continues to provoke to this day. In addition to reading and discussing the poem, students will become familiar with ongoing sites of critical debate, such as the representations of Satan and of Eve. To help negotiate these conversations, students will complete a guided research project that makes use of the materials available through the library's Department of Special Collections, housed in Brody Learning Commons. In addition to early editions of Paradise Lost, this treasure trove of rare books offers a wide variety of materials which may deepen an encounter with Milton's poem, from biblical illustrations to gardening manuals to marriage advice. Students will use the collection to ask questions such as: \"How does Milton's representation of Satan differ from earlier traditions of imagining the devil?\" and \"Does Milton's approach to Eve reinforce or revise conventional ideas about women?\" Sufficient class time will be dedicated to introducing students to Special Collections so as to facilitate their individual work over the course of the semester.",

In the postcolonial era of the 1980s and 90s, many prominent writers explored the process of diasporic movement from one country to another. Recently, though, there has been a lot of talk about a new kind of “rootless” novel that jumps between many locales around the globe. This course reads some of the prime examples of this genre in relation to its immigrant predecessors, identifying its key formal and thematic attributes (such as perspectival and geographical range, multi-stranded plots, and an acute consciousness of linguistic and generic hybridization). We will discuss the trade-offs inherent in developing many places rather than one in terms of style and character development, as well as the political and even ethical implications of abandoning the concept of “home.” Primary works by Abdulrazak Gurnah, Caryl Phillips, David Mitchell, Taiye Selasi, Chimamanda Adichie, and Imraan Coovadia.",

Yet the academic study of literature tends to sideline or bracket visual images, insisting (often for very good reasons) upon an encounter with texts alone. This course reads works that combine media in order to pose and perhaps answer some basic questions: which aspects of our ingrained critical habits of reading and interpreting literature have to change in order to read images and texts together? How do these distinct representational media complicate or critique each other? How has this relationship changed over time? From Renaissance emblem books to graphic novels and beyond, this transhistorical course will assess the relationship between images and texts through a series of close encounters with works that combine image and text in ways that are alternately funny and scary, intuitive and experimental, old fashioned and cutting edge. Possible texts/authors include: Geoffrey Whitney & Andrea Alciati, “A Choice of Emblems”; William Blake, “Songs of Innocence” and “Songs of Experience”; Marshall Mcluhan & Quentin Fiore, “The Medium is the Massage: An Inventory of Effects”; W.G.

Over the course of its sprawling Six Books and its concluding Mutability Cantos, The Faerie Queene marshals an enormous cast of characters (knights, ladies, magicians, giants, monsters) in order to allegorically represent the virtues of Holiness, Temperance, Chastity, Friendship, Justice and Courtesy. Through this framework, his text models the ethical regulation of the body, the aesthetic construction of gender, the politics of national myth-making, and the ongoing processes of colonial violence in which Spenser was himself complicit. But across its vast yet incomplete expanse, Spenser’s text is always centrally concerned with the task of reading. Accordingly, students should emerge from their encounter with this demanding but rewarding poem with a deeper understanding of the task of interpretation itself. As a group we will collectively traverse the surface of the text, and work together to construct a functional account of allegory’s effects. You will be asked to respond to the challenge of Spenser’s work in class discussion, weekly short responses, and three analytic papers.",

Our readings are roughly organized according to chronology and genre. We will think about the adapted and emergent generic forms through which “the New World” was ongoingly invented, including genres like the Indian captivity narrative and the slave narrative that arguably make their debut in world literary history in the Americas during this time frame. We will conclude by attending to the rather late emergence of the novel in American literary history, reading four novels that appeared in the early US national period. The objective of the course is simply to contextualize and analyze a wide array of texts, each of which richly rewards the engaged reader, in order to trace the origins of American literatures. Course texts may include contact narratives (Columbus, Caminha, Smith, Hennepin); conquest narratives (Mather, Las Casas, Poma de Ayala); Indian captivity narratives (Cabeza de Vaca, Rowlandson, Staden); slave narratives (Gronniosaw, Jea, Cugoano); revolutionary polemics (Paine, Bolívar); and the earliest American novels: William Hill Brown, The Power of Sympathy; Hannah Webster Foster, The Coquette; Leonora Sansay, Secret History or, the Horrors of Santo Domingo; Charles Brockden Brown, Arthur Mervyn.

Literary representations of, and meditations upon, violence will be considered in Spenser, Nashe, Marlowe, Milton and Behn. Early modern thinkers will include humanists, theologians and philosophers (Augustine, Ficino, Calvin, Hobbes, Spinoza, Locke). We will consider such topics as: How religion is (or is not) a ‘transhistorical’ category; how the Enlightenment’s critique of religion was founded on the experience of the ‘wars of religion’; the creation of religious Others; the connection between religion and the rise of the modern state; the war-peace distinction; the friend-enemy distinction; how the sacredness of human life is understood; the links between violence and humanitarianism (indeed, what is the human?); torture; ‘violence’ as a transhistorical category; the pairing of violence to justice.

Unfortunately, we often lack the information necessary to obtain our desired goal with complete certainty. Economists have long been interested in understanding human decision-making under these circumstances. In parallel, neuroscientists have made great strides at describing the underlying neural basis of simple decision-making. However, despite much progress in both fields, our understanding of how the brain makes decisions is incomplete. In order to strengthen and further research in both fields, the interdisciplinary field of Neuroeconomics arose. This course will survey the field of Neuroeconomics focusing on theoretical concepts developed by economists and the role these theories are playing in guiding current experimental neuroscience.

Both schools thought that although we live in a material and causally determined universe, our moral actions and characters are nevertheless “up to us” and that we have moral freedom and responsibility. The Skeptics, on the other hand, tried to demonstrate that no moral principles have sufficient rational justification and that, because of this, the only option is some kind of moral relativism and the pursuit of freedom from emotional disturbance. In this, they anticipated moral relativism and moral nihilism.

    "description" : "Are human beings distinctively valuable? What makes us valuable? And how should we respond to the value of human beings? The course is divided into four parts. The first part takes up questions about the basis of human value. We consider various proposals, including Kant's, about the valuable feature or capacity of human beings. Are we valuable in virtue of having a good will, in virtue of being agents, in virtue of being valuers, or something further? The second part takes up questions about the explanation of the value of human beings. Does the proposed feature make us valuable because it instantiates a simple value property, making us valuable in ourselves, or simpliciter? We consider whether the notion of value simpliciter is a notion we fully understand, or need. Does the proposed feature make us valuable because it makes us good-for something or someone? Who or what does it make us good-for? Or again, does the proposed feature make us such that we are objects of an appropriate attitude or practical stance? If so, what is the attitude or stance? The third part of the course takes up normative questions about the appropriate mode of responding to human beings. We consider whether it makes sense to say that human beings are \"ends-in-themselves,\" and what it would mean to treat a person as an end-in-itself. We also consider various accounts of respect. A guiding question is whether human beings are the only appropriate objects of respect, or whether we can respect other beings, and even artifacts. The fourth part of the class applies what we have learned so far to related topics: to the question of whether human life or existence is valuable, and conversely, whether death is disvaluable. We consider, albeit briefly, the value of human beings in relation to the value of animals. And we ask about the role of Kantian notions like dignity in applied contexts, so that highly philosophical considerations about value are shown to have real-world bearing.",

What is the relation between the expereince of time (for example, the experience of time's passage) and memory? Does our experience of time accurately represent temporal features of reality, or it is actually illusory? How does attending to time's passage affect its perceived rate of passage (and what is it to attend to time's passage)?

But what work does critical thought do for the early moderns? It certainly constructs the canon, it regiments the Republic of Letters, it can be seen to create the concept of a literary field. It marks boundaries, invents new languages, even new genres (is the novel always a criticism of its own genre?). Is it only the practitioner of an art who is competent to write the criticism of that art? How does the concept of critical thought evolve over the Long Eighteenth Century, and how does it mutate in the early Romantic period?

The term “pop(ular) culture” designates cultural products and practices that are disseminated as ‘mass culture.’ Pop culture is accessible to many and deals with objects and materials that circulate in the everyday life of a society; it functions, one might say, as a cultural archive of the present. In contrast to high culture, pop culture enjoys an ambiguous reputation: It represents the cultural mainstream, functions as an easily consumable commodity and promotes the marketing of dominant ideologies, in the view of critical theory. However, more recent debates within cultural studies discuss pop culture as a site of social-symbolic conflicts and subversive forms of reception. Against this background, the seminar examines pop-culture phenomena in Germany after 1950, including the cult object: soccer, popular film and TV (“Tatort”), German pop music and hits (from “Hitparade” to “Rosenstolz” and beyond), recent pop literature after 1990 (Sibylle Berg, Rainald Götz, Thomas Meinecke).

With the exact sciences still being invented, the nature of the world was much less hard and fast for Renaissance people than it is for the modern educated person. The literary masterpieces of the Italian Renaissance provide vivid illustrations of the early modern sense of wonder. Foremost among these are the theatrical comedies which Italian authors revived in imitation of the ancients, and the romances, especially Ariosto’s Orlando furioso (1532) and Tasso’s Gerusalemme liberata (1581).

Reading materials will include classical sources (e.g. Plato, Aristotle, Ps.-Longinus, Quintilian) and their early modern interpretations. Special attention will be given to Torquato Tasso, Giambattista Marino, and Giambattista Doni, whose works will be also discussed in the light of the contemporary development of musical genres (e.g. madrigals, opera).

The course aims to analyze the development of Foscolo's poetry in the years between the eighteenth and nineteenth centuries (1798-1807), namely the development from the sonnets and the odes to the poem I Sepolcri, starting off from the most common models of the famous contemporary poets (Parini, Monti, Alfieri, Pindemonte) to arrive at a new understanding of \"lyric poetry.\" Furthermore, the lectures will focus on the discussions and controversy that arose with regards to the Sepolcri (with Pindemonte and others) immediately after publication, when the novelty of the poem aroused bewilderment and perplexity in many critics, readers and poets. The analysis of the anti-Foscolo writings that appeared at this time - and the replies of Foscolo himself - will show how most of the readers of that time, still tied to a static view of literary genres, were negatively affected by the audacity in the mixture of the various registers that characterize the poem (epic, lyric, elegy, satire, tragedy) held responsible both for the lack of formal and stylistic unity of the poem, and its complete obscurity.

The course also considers case studies of current policy debates in the US, such as housing segregation and school resegregation, voucher programs for school choice, and the motivation for and consequences of the establishment of state-mandated testing requirements. Throughout the course, emphasis is placed upon the alternative modes of inquiry and writing which opposing scholars, policymakers, and journalists use to address these contentious topics.",

    "description" : "The enormous gains in environmental protection achieved in the latter half of the 20th century in the United States can primarily be credited to legal policy instruments that targeted point-source pollution through legislation such as the Clean Air Act and Clean Water Act. However, that successful framework has been ill-equipped to handle the myriad sources of greenhouse gas emissions that contribute to climate change, and passing new national climate change legislation has remained frustratingly out of reach. To meet these challenges, citizens will need to make both political and consumer decisions about climate change and energy. Public attitudes influence what is believed to be politically possible in passing new legislation, and consumer decisions contribute to as much as 40% of national emissions. These conditions have generated renewed interests in low-cost, non-regulatory “soft policy” approaches based on social science to inform public decision-making and behavior change. Communication—whether in the form of information provision, participatory decision-making, or social marketing—is among the foremost of these strategies. This course will introduce you to a growing literature on the use of social science research in informing and evaluating climate change and energy policies. Understanding some of the terms and concepts used in social science research will help you critically evaluate research commissioned by the organizations for which you work, or even just survey toplines reported by the media.

    "description" : "The United States has experienced the most significant failure of its financial system since the Great Depression. Differences in governance and management between the survivors and the others are instructive not only for financial firms, but for government agencies and private companies in other sectors of the economy. This course seeks to present learnings that are potentially relevant to government managers and organizations. The basic lesson, of course, is that low probability events with devastating consequences do happen. Nicolas Nassim Taleb (2007) calls such events “black swans.” He argues that they take place much more frequently than people expect. Managers must take the possibility of black swans into account even when times are good; that’s one factor that distinguishes the survivors from the rest. The federal government and private sector have learned this from Katrina, the massive 2010 Gulf oil spill, homeland security events such as September 11, and the Great Recession that emerged from the financial crisis. All of these occurred within a single decade. Students will be expected to produce a research paper on an approved topic relating to (1) a crosscutting theme of governance and risk management at one or more private companies, (2) government regulation and supervision of risk management at one or more private companies, or (3) a cross-cutting theme of governance and risk management at government agencies. Students will be encouraged to make the course an interactive one and to share their personal knowledge of successes and failures of governance and risk management.

Anyone interested in international affairs should take a look at this fascinating and challenging power with a 5,000 year history which has risen to become one of the world’s two superpowers. Whether in trade, investment, culture, education, diplomacy or security, China is a big player in almost every single field. Its meteoric rise of the past 35 years is not without drawbacks. In the West, a lot of people resent its lack of democratic institutions and poor environment; in Asia, neighbors such as Japan, India, Vietnam or The Philippines remain wary about security challenges brought by an ever assertive China; in Africa or Latin American, where Chinese State-owned Enterprises have been tapping into natural resources to fuel the Chinese economic engine, populations are worried about this “neo-colonialism” and are asking: what’s in it for us? One of the most difficult tasks China needs to handle is its own image, as well as the way it handles its global influence. For example, there are many contradictions: In a number of countries where it is investing heavily, China recently suffered a drop in its positive influence. It is no longer enough to be the world's most populated country, a manufacturing powerhouse, a UN Security Council permanent member or a rising military power. This course will explore how China needs to exert all aspects of leadership including better communication with the rest of the world, and the rest of the world needs to learn how to communicate better with China.",

Rather, organisms must develop, move, interact, and function in their natural environment, and thus are constrained by the laws of physics. For example, during locomotion an animal must accelerate according to Newton's laws by applying forces between itself and the environment. Beyond physical principles alone, biological systems extensively use feedback to enhance stability and facilitate adaptation in the presence of a changing world. This course examines the critical roles that physical principles and feedback mechanisms play in life, with special emphasis on animal locomotion and its control. Juniors and Seniors only.",

Because use of the computer is extremely important when “mining” large amounts of data, we will make substantial use of data mining software tools to learn the techniques and analyze datasets.

    "description" : "Often the success of a machine learning project depends on the choice of features used. Machine learning has made great progress in training classification, regression and recognition systems when \"good\" representations, or features, of input data are available. However, much human effort is spent on designing good features which are usually knowledge-based and engineered by domain experts over years of trial and error. A natural question to ask then is \"Can we automate the learning of useful features from raw data?\" Representation learning algorithms such as principal component analysis aim at discovering better representations of inputs by learning transformations of data that disentangle factors of variation in data while retaining most of the information. The success of such data-driven approaches to feature learning depends not only on how much data we can process but also on how well the features that we learn correlate with the underlying unknown labels (semantic content in the data). This course will focus on scalable machine learning approaches for learning representations from large amounts of unlabeled, multi-modal, and heterogeneous data. We will cover topics including deep learning, multi-view learning, dimensionality reduction, similarity-based learning, and spectral learning.

Beginning in the prior spring semester (start of HIV-PCC Program), students will have been assigned 1 day per week in an HIV primary care setting. In this course, students have the opportunity to critically evaluate the care they have provided over the last 12 months. Students will be required to conduct panel management reviews of primary care guideline adherence, discussion of integration of interprofessional team approaches, review of challenging cases and all hospitalizations as well as ethical decisions in care such as palliative care decision making. Students will be required to directly address ways to reduce health disparities across their patient panel. Comorbidity management in collaboration with other specialists will also be emphasized by requiring a specialty clinical rotation. This course has a central focus on high quality primary care for the PLWHA and associated comorbidity. The student will complete a minimum of 56 clinical hours in HIV specialty care settings. Placement will be prioritized based on clinical experiences to date. For example, if a student has already had substantial experience with Hepatitis/HIV co-infection, we will prioritize students for such placement who have not had a similar experience.

    "description" : "This course (Investing in Emerging Markets) will introduce students to the opportunities, issues, and challenges that come with investing in emerging markets. The course will begin with an introduction followed by a second lecture which will recap the ways in which investment opportunities are analyzed and the investment process. It will then explore the economic structure of emerging markets before reviewing economic growth, business cycles and the linkage between growth and investment returns in emerging economies. The course will then cover the instruments available to investors interested in emerging markets by looking at the capital markets in these economies as well as the alternative investment vehicles that currently exist. The course will then look at the ways in which emerging markets differ from developed markets. Topics covered in this section of the course will include political risk; business culture and practices; economic risk – specifically currency and inflation risk; legal and regulatory risk; integrity issues (corruption, political connections etc.); and practical challenges that are inherent in many emerging economies (poor infrastructure, management skills and practices etc). The lecture series will conclude with a lecture on current topics in emerging markets before providing students a framework through which investments in emerging markets might be considered. To ensure that students are exposed to the practical application of the theory, lectures throughout the course will include practical examples and grading will include a major practical assignment (including a mock presentation to an investment committee) as well as three case studies. This course will not involve any financial modeling, but students will be required to understand corporate accounts and financial projections.

After an introductory lecture, it will begin by examining “infrastructure” – what it is and why it is so important to long-term economic growth and development. It will then review the way infrastructure projects are developed through public-private partnerships (PPPs) and the role of the public and private sectors in this process. As a part of this analysis, the course will look the positive and negative aspects of such partnerships, the risks involved, and the perspectives of both public and private organizations. To ensure that students are exposed to the practical application of the theory, lectures throughout the course will include practical examples and grading will include a major practical assignment as well as three case studies. A primer in finance, with a focus on modeling for PPPs will also be included as this is critical to understanding the decision-making frameworks that are used by both the public and private sectors.

In this course we review the main challenges to effective and reliable service delivery, roles of key players and how these roles have been changing over time. We begin by discussing the role of the state in service provision, why some services are harder to provide, or some populations more difficult to serve. Next, we focus on four sectors—drinking water, sanitation, solid waste and public transport. Problems specific to each sector, policies and programs used to address these challenges, to what extent they have been successful and why, and what approaches may work in the future, will be discussed. Innovations in service delivery—clearer incentives for regular service provision, strengthening municipal financing, integrating the private sector and communities into service provision, will be highlighted.

Public-Private Partnerships are collaborative structures supported by public, private or even non-profit partners who agree to share risks, resources and decisions in building and implementing certain projects. PPPs address issues with financing, operational capacity, inadequate human capital. The parties to a solution may share powerful motivations to create public value by addressing a particular problem but may not agree on how it should be addressed, by whom, at what risk, and for what incentives. The course will discuss how the integration of economic and social PPPs can improve a country’s competitiveness. While economic PPPs are created to address strategic economic development goals, social PPPs focus more on assets that lack adequate revenue sources and require subsidies. An increasing number of countries are seeking a fusion of economic and social PPPs, especially with regard to water, education, and healthcare. The skills needed to effectively develop and integrate economic and social PPPs include negotiation, political management, innovation, and financial structuring. Case studies and readings will be used to illustrate the wide spectrum of situations and challenges associated with managing PPPs and the types of issues that will benefit from PPPs in international development.

We will consider the lessons these negotiations provide for the evolution of the international sustainable development system as well as for negotiation theory. We will examine who participates in these negotiations and their incentives to favor or oppose agreements on environmental issues. The course will first examine the international negotiating system for environmental policy and examine how particular features of environmental issues influence international negotiations. Several sessions will be devoted to developing an understanding of negotiation theory and frameworks for analyzing negotiations. During these sessions, the class will use the readings to develop a framework for understanding and evaluating international negotiations. The course then turns to case studies, focusing in particular on the negotiation of the SDGs and the ongoing climate change negotiations. For each case, we will apply the framework that we developed during the first half of the class and evaluate alternative explanations for the negotiation outcomes.

Or is this looming crisis over-hyped, a matter of political will and proper pricing, and within the capacity of society to manage? Water is a classic renewable resource, essential to life on this planet. Water sustains the livelihoods of society and makes productive economic activity possible. For such an important resource, it is no wonder that issues surrounding its use (and abuse) can generate cause for so much passionate controversy and concern. This course is a broad survey of the international water issues facing the 21st century. Topics to be covered include, privatization of water service delivery, conflict and cooperation on trans-boundary rivers, the role of large multi-purpose reservoirs (for hydropower, water supply, irrigation), water as a human right, achieving the Millennium Development Goals on water supply and sanitation, the role of water in food security, and climate change. Any discourse today on sustainable development is not complete without a discussion of the important role of water to society. Click here to see evaluations, syllabi, and faculty bios",

The course will also focus on the new nexus of climate change, physical infrastructure, global security, global financial and economic stability, and resilient and sustainable economic development. The course will be based on the best current scientific understanding of the ways in which economically important activities affect the physical and chemical properties of the atmosphere. It will assess the ways in which global warming due to the atmospheric buildup of greenhouse gases may affect agriculture, forestry, fisheries, human health, urbanization, and coastal zone development. Our discussions will highlight the ways in which global warming may exacerbate intra- and inter-regional tensions; inflame economic and geopolitical rivalries; and complicate the challenges associated with achieving the United Nation’s Millennium Development Goals. We will examine how strategies to catalyze new public-private investment partnerships and to enhance inter-regional and international cooperation could increase resilience, adaptive capacity and security. Finally, we will assess the role of sustainable and resilient infrastructure investments in assuring the inclusive and equitable economic growth of nations in the face of the dynamic and multi-dimensional challenges that already confront the international community.

This course will examine the policy framework required to achieve this. It will begin with an overview of the elements needed to drive technology innovation in general, along with the types of policies to spur these elements. The course will then apply this analysis to the specifics of accelerating energy technology innovation, discussing a framework for energy technology policies. Strategies used to drive energy technology innovation in major countries around the world—including both OECD and the more advanced developing countries—will then be examined, beginning with the U.S.. The assessment of the United States will include an examination of its innovation system institutions: their strengths and gaps in driving energy technology innovation, including recent programs to address those gaps, and an analysis of what remains to be done. The course will conclude with an examination of approaches being considered to spur energy technology innovation as part of the climate negotiations. Since this course focuses on policies to achieve energy innovation, it is a good complement to the “Energy Technology Futures” course, which focuses on future technologies and their risks and benefits.

    "description" : "The course has been designed to help students understand what public value can be created and what complex public policy problems can be addressed by employing the techniques and structures used in public-private partnerships (PPPs). Public-Private Partnerships are collaborative structures supported by public, private or even non-profit partners who agree to share risks, resources and decisions in building and implementing certain projects. PPPs address issues with financing, operational capacity, inadequate human capital. The parties to a solution may share powerful motivations to create public value by addressing a particular problem but may not agree on how it should be addressed, by whom, at what risk, and for what incentives. The course will focus on a selection of ERE case studies, highlighting how economic PPPs can improve a country’s competitiveness. The course will also cover social PPPs, which focus more on assets that lack an adequate revenue source and require subsidies, such as water. An increasing number of countries are seeking a fusion of economic and social PPPs, especially with regard to water, education, and healthcare. The skills needed to effectively develop and integrate economic and social PPPs include negotiation, political management, innovation, and financial structuring. Case studies and readings will be used to illustrate the wide spectrum of situations and challenges associated with PPPs and the types of issues that will benefit from PPPs. Students enrolled in the course will be eligible for PPP research assistant positions and internship opportunities in the public and private sectors.

The establishment of the Islamic Republic of Iran dramatically transformed the nation’s internal politics, economy, and society, and its impact echoed well beyond Iran’s borders to reconfigure the geostrategic balance in the Middle East. Over the course of the next 33 years, Iran’s revolutionary theocracy has been at the center of what former national security advisor Zbigniew Brzezinski has described as “the arc of crisis” that spans North Africa to South Asia. As the heavyweight power in a crucial region, with unique religious and cultural sway, situated at the crux of global energy resources and transportation routes, Iran would inevitably rank high on the American security agenda irrespective of its leadership. That importance is magnified by the persistence of antagonism between Tehran and Washington as well as by the Islamic Republic's contentious role in the region. Once again, Iran once again finds itself in history’s spotlight, thanks to negotiations over Tehran's nuclear ambitions that have yielded the first sign of diplomatic progress in a decade-long impasse. What happens next in Iran’s always compelling narrative will have dramatic repercussions not only for its 70 million citizens, but for its neighbors, the world economy, and American interests in the Middle East. This course is intended to provide a comprehensive understanding the forces shaping Iran’s domestic political evolution and its international relations.

Our course will be built around five core operas, one from each main decade of Verdi’s compositional output. Students will leave with the tools to understand how his works were put together and to what dramatic ends; to contrast his operas with those that premiered around the same time—and thus reach a more nuanced idea about the composer’s role in the nineteenth-century compositional scene than would otherwise be possible—and to understand how his works were intended as commodities, written with audiences as diverse as those in Milan, Paris and St.Petersburg in mind.",

Dr. Shinichi Suzuki's philosophy embraces the idea that all children are born with musical ability that can be nurtured at an early age through their environment, listening, imitation, and by working closely with a parent at home. Paul Rolland's work focuses on relaxation and freedom of movement in string playing. Traditional string pedagogy enhances these approaches by incorporating the development of technique and musicianship through scales, etudes, sight reading a, and a variety of repertoire. Our faculty members bring their own experiences to the program as they work together in creating a solid foundation and inspiring environment for our young string players. For more information on the YPSP, please call the Preparatory Office at 410-234-4630 or visit our website. YPSP students attend a private lesson and a group lesson each week. Parent participation is required. The total tuition for The Young People's String Program is based on the cost of individual instruction and the tuition cost for the assigned YPSP Group.

The course is designed to provide students with a firm grounding in the Constitutional debates and phraseology defining the carefully balanced powers of the Presidency and the Congress and the safeguards meant to protect civil liberties in wartime. The course tracks the development of a security state mentality in the years since the Second World War and illustrates how this has radically changed America’s view of its constitutional democracy, its global military role and its place in the international economy. Twenty-five years after the end of the cold war, presidential war powers and federal government spying on US citizens are again the subject of lively debate. The rise of an intermittently libertarian and constitutional Tea Party caucus in Congress, fiscal pressures on the Pentagon budget, the documents disclosed by Bradley/Chelsea Manning and the labor market upheavals caused by globalization and the Great Recession have all helped fuel this debate .

That challenge is both methodological and substantive. Students will have to tackle ‘how’ we understand and ‘what’ we understand at the same time. Along the way, they will have to consider those things we cannot understand or anticipate with any meaningful degree of precision. They will have to deal with the ‘uncertainty’ that lies beyond the boundaries of ‘risk’. The subject matter is open-ended. Virtually every aspect of politics or economics can be cast in terms of risk and uncertainty, no matter whether we look to the future or reflect upon the past. Therefore, the course builds on a thematically structured, case study approach. Each week introduces a new principle that is useful in understanding risk; each week provides cases that illustrate the usefulness of that new principle. Moreover, as our understanding of risk becomes more sophisticated, the cases become more complex. The ultimate goal is to be able to analyze matters of risk and uncertainty as they manifest around decisions taken by leaders in government or business in the real world.",

Questions to be examined include the following: Is the partnership of feminism and multiculturalism necessarily agonistic? In a culturally diverse world, what constitutes gender (in)equality? To which extent should democracies accommodate communal cultures inimical to liberal gender equality? Is there an emerging international and/or European model of accommodating cultural diversity which nevertheless adequately takes into account the gender dimension?
