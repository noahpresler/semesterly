To help negotiate these conversations, students will complete a guided research project that makes use of the materials available through the library's Department of Special Collections, housed in Brody Learning Commons. In addition to early editions of Paradise Lost, this treasure trove of rare books offers a wide variety of materials which may deepen an encounter with Milton's poem, from biblical illustrations to gardening manuals to marriage advice.

Are we valuable in virtue of having a good will, in virtue of being agents, in virtue of being valuers, or something further? The second part takes up questions about the explanation of the value of human beings. Does the proposed feature make us valuable because it instantiates a simple value property, making us valuable in ourselves, or simpliciter? We consider whether the notion of value simpliciter is a notion we fully understand, or need. Does the proposed feature make us valuable because it makes us good-for something or someone? Who or what does it make us good-for? Or again, does the proposed feature make us such that we are objects of an appropriate attitude or practical stance? If so, what is the attitude or stance? The third part of the course takes up normative questions about the appropriate mode of responding to human beings. We consider whether it makes sense to say that human beings are \"ends-in-themselves,\" and what it would mean to treat a person as an end-in-itself. We also consider various accounts of respect. A guiding question is whether human beings are the only appropriate objects of respect, or whether we can respect other beings, and even artifacts. The fourth part of the class applies what we have learned so far to related topics: to the question of whether human life or existence is valuable, and conversely, whether death is disvaluable.

Machine learning has made great progress in training classification, regression and recognition systems when \"good\" representations, or features, of input data are available. However, much human effort is spent on designing good features which are usually knowledge-based and engineered by domain experts over years of trial and error. A natural question to ask then is \"Can we automate the learning of useful features from raw data?\" Representation learning algorithms such as principal component analysis aim at discovering better representations of inputs by learning transformations of data that disentangle factors of variation in data while retaining most of the information.

PPPs address issues with financing, operational capacity, inadequate human capital.

Public-Private Partnerships are collaborative structures supported by public, private or even non-profit partners who agree to share risks, resources and decisions in building and implementing certain projects. PPPs address issues with financing, operational capacity, inadequate human capital. The parties to a solution may share powerful motivations to create public value by addressing a particular problem but may not agree on how it should be addressed, by whom, at what risk, and for what incentives. The course will focus on a selection of ERE case studies, highlighting how economic PPPs can improve a country\u2019s competitiveness. The course will also cover social PPPs, which focus more on assets that lack an adequate revenue source and require subsidies, such as water. An increasing number of countries are seeking a fusion of economic and social PPPs, especially with regard to water, education, and healthcare. The skills needed to effectively develop and integrate economic and social PPPs include negotiation, political management, innovation, and financial structuring. Case studies and readings will be used to illustrate the wide spectrum of situations and challenges associated with PPPs and the types of issues that will benefit from PPPs.

As the heavyweight power in a crucial region, with unique religious and cultural sway, situated at the crux of global energy resources and transportation routes, Iran would inevitably rank high on the American security agenda irrespective of its leadership.
