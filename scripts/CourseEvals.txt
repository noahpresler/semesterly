Carolyn Fitch

Overall quality of the class: 3.85

Summary:
Students praised this course for giving them the ability not only to learn new skills but apply those skills
as well. Issues with the course varied, though multiple students found there was a steep learning curve
in the first few weeks and that feedback wasn't provided in a timely manner to students resulting in
repeating costly mistakes on assignments. Similarly, suggestions for improvement focused on a general
request that assignments be better spaced out to allow time for feedback in between the due date for
the next assignment, or that feedback on assignments simply be returned to students more quickly.
Prospective students should know that having some background in general lab procedure and
programming is helpful for this course, although the class is accessible to a freshman.

there was a discussion/lecture class and a lab-focused class. Prospective students should know that
students broadly described this course as fun and a great introduction to laboratory techniques.

AS.250.315.01
Biochemistry I
Patrick Fleming

Overall quality of the class: 4.27

Summary:
Students broadly praised this course for having a friendly and engaging instructor who covered
interesting subject matter. Students did not like the course's brief quizzes which could be hit or miss in
terms of success. Students also said that results on the quizzes accounted for a large percentage of their
grades, and since each one only consisted of four or five questions, one wrong answer could send a
grade plummeting on the quiz. Suggestions for improvement included a desire by multiple students for
the quizzes to be overhauled either by increasing the number of questions or switching from multiple
choice questions to short-answer questions. Prospective students should know that the course requires
a good amount of independent study by students and success on the course's quizzes is critical to
overall success.

interesting guest lecturers who engaged students on relevant topics. Students had very few issues with
the course although some students found that since the course had rotating instructors there was a lack
of continuity in the course and the quality of each speaker could vary. Suggestions for improvement
varied; however, some students wished the course had fewer students in order to allow more in-class
discussion or that the course had a separate discussion section. Prospective students should know that
the course was highly recommended and, even though the course description said there were no
prerequisites, some general knowledge of biology was necessary for success in the course.

professor's knowledgeable guidance. The worst aspects of the course were the amount of reading due
each week and the long class meeting time. Meeting for a shorter time over two days and reducing the
number of novels were suggestions to improve the course. Prospective students should know that the
class requires a lot of reading, but the material was interesting and students found they gained a deeper
understanding of difficult texts. The class and professor are highly recommended.

American Literature, 1865 to today
Christopher Nealon

Overall quality of the class: 4.09

Summary:
The instructor was overwhelmingly thought of by students as the best aspect of this class. His lectures
were interesting and engaging, the range of readings was well thought out, and his enthusiasm for the
subject was infectious. A heavy reading schedule was far and away the worst aspect of the class. Some
students also noted ineffectual teaching assistant sections as detracting from the course. A common
suggestion to improve the course was to assign fewer long readings and focus on shorter works.
Students interested in this course should know that there was a lot of reading in the course, but the
reading was generally enjoyable. Students didn't need a background in U.S. history and the instructor
was recommended.

The Bible as Literature
Mark Thompson

Overall quality of the class: 3.73

Summary:
The best aspects of this course included the chance to read such a ubiquitous text through a new lens,
lectures that were informative and objective, and fairly light reading load, despite the topic. Many
students thought the instructor was knowledgeable and passionate about the subject. The course was
disorganized and there were several versions of the syllabus, leaving many students confused. Smaller
classes, making readings available online, and more time to cover such a vast topic were suggestions to
improve the course. Prospective students should be aware that there will be interpretations of the Bible
that may not be agreeable to those with a strict religious background, but they will provide literary
criticism and unconventional views of the stories. Prior knowledge of the Bible was helpful, but not
necessary.

interactivity for the students. Prospective students should know that as the name of the course implies,

requires a similar amount of reading.

Summary:
This class was highlighted by a great instructor, frequent chances to listen and practice speaking, and a
reasonable pace. Many students thought their questions about assignments or concepts were answered

portion of homework, and the lack of some basic vocabulary lessons. Suggestions to improve the course
include using a better textbook and giving more basic vocabulary in class. Prospective students should
know that there is a steady workload that should be attended to daily. The class provides a great

The worst aspect of the class was by far the online tool, Sentieri. Students overwhelmingly found it to be
disjointed from the rest of class and an overwhelming amount of work. Suggestions to improve the class
included more opportunities to practice composition and fewer online assignments. Prospective
students should know the class is less intimidating for those with some previous Romance language, but
it is not necessary. The workload is consistent but manageable and the course provides a great
introduction to Italian.

semester rather than one midterm and one final, and giving more opportunities to practice speaking in
class. Prospective students should know that the course requires a good deal of time each week outside
of class but you will be surprised by how much you learn in a few months.

The best aspects of this class included the small class size, opportunities for conversation and the
constant interaction and feedback in the classroom. Many students gave the professor high praise for
his attentive and knowledgeable teaching style. However, the online assignments felt repetitive and
useless, and the movie was difficult to understand. Suggestions to improve the class included replacing
the textbook, having in class presentations rather than the voice thread assignments, and more
opportunities to practice speaking in class. Prospective students should know that the class, like most
languages, requires regular studying to do well, but the grading is very fair and the professor makes class

Students praised this course for covering interesting subject matter. They also liked the way the
instructor peppered lectures with interesting personal stories and anecdotes. Perceived issues with the
course focused on a belief that the course lacked a bit of structure; some students said the instructor

said they felt that midterms and papers were graded harshly and points were taken off assignments for
unexplained reasons. Suggestions for improvement included a belief from multiple students that the
course needed additional structure; some students wanted the instructor to update the course's
syllabus as changes occurred while another student wanted clear expectations for graded assignments.
Prospective students should know that students felt the course had a fair workload and that it was a
great introduction to Michelangelo and the Renaissance. While students felt a background in history

write. Prospective students should know that the course had a very heavy reading schedule with regular
essay assignments, but the reading was interesting and intellectually stimulating.

Summary:
Students thought highlights from the class included reading such a wide variety of books that spanned
such a long time period and that were so intellectually challenging. The chance to hand in first drafts of
essays for ungraded feedback was also greatly appreciated. The worst aspect of the class was the lack of
discussion during section meetings. The class could be improved by reducing the number of books so

the challenge of this class were some of the highlights. Professors with expertise in each book lead the
lecture, giving more insight into the various topics that would have been gained otherwise. The worst
aspect of the course was the pace of the reading assignments. Assigning fewer books over the semester
so more time could be spent on each was a common suggestion to improve the course. Prospective

more time on Baltimore-specific issues, reducing the workload by a third, and clarifying grading
methods. Students considering this course should know that the workload could be overwhelming, but

experiences. They also enjoyed how this course provided an overview of many cultures in the near east.
Students' issues with the course varied; multiple students thought that there was a significant amount
of assigned reading. Multiple students thought many of the assigned readings were irrelevant to the
class as it seemed the instructor didn't tie the readings into the lecture or test them on the exams.
Suggestions for improvement varied as some students thought the course would be improved if the
course better integrated assigned readings into the lecture and assignments, while others wanted the
instructor to assign additional work so that students' grades wouldn't be dependent on how they do on
a couple of assignments. Prospective students should know that students found that the course was a

based on how well they did on essays. Suggestions to improve the course varied although several
students wished the course would spend more time digging into the empires that were examined in the
course. Prospective students should know that the course focused on three empires and the course was
a writing intensive course.

Introduction to Theatre
Joseph Martin

Overall quality of the class: 3.25

Summary:
Students praised this course for giving them the opportunity to explore plays that they wouldn't
ordinarily have been exposed to. Students believed the course lacked structure with students noting
that assignments listed on the syllabus weren't discussed and another noting that it was unclear what
the instructor wanted on assignments given the large amount of freedom he provided to students.
Suggestions for improvement included a desire by multiple students that the course would be improved
if the instructor gave clearer expectations of what he wanted from students on assignments and if the
lectures had a more logical flow. Prospective students should know that students found the course
focused more on the history of theater and didn't require any background in the arts.

Overall quality of the class: 4.64

Summary:
Students praised this course for its small size which allowed lessons to be tailored to each student's level
and growth. Perceived issues with the course varied. Multiple students believed that they missed out on
opportunities to run through scenes or receive feedback because time wasn't managed as effectively as
possible. In addition, students found the readings could become intensely heavy, particularly when
students had to be working to memorize their lines. Suggestions to improve the course largely focused
on a desire for students to have more opportunities to receive critiques on their abilities with one
student suggesting bi-weekly one-on-one meetings between individual students and the instructor.
Prospective students should know that students found that the course didn't require or expect students
to have a background in acting; however, students had to be prepared to study scenes and memorize
lines outside of class.

direction.
