TO-DOs
----------
 - EVALS do not exist. No public or private centralized repository for course evaluations exist. Course evaluations
   are recorded every semester individually by each department and are viewable for a few months only to the staff teaching the 
   course at the end of the semester before being purged.

 - Deal with 9 different section types
 	--> currently overloading the 3 types in the model 

 - Some courses don't have full course names in the API response - needs to be addressed without
 having to manually go through all of the courses and changing the names
    -- UPDATE: IT confirms that the data they receive from departments comes in this form and they are not able to fix it

 - Some descriptions are empty
    -- UPDATE: IT confirms again that the aren't able to fix as this data is pulled directly from the departments]

NOTES
----------
Umich has an API that can be accessed with a token provided only to enrolled students
Requests from each token is throttled to no more than 60 per minute. Multiple tokens
from current students are being used to get around this issue. Tokens listed below:

"6e15388418fa2483841755f5e2d5eba"
"5562e94b39dccc2eaaab181e0c4ee"
"c03cae2d767ab4c525d1ce5b57a965"
"dfccf802a589fcbdbfa6b4e906e1bb6"
"b0555cfc4e7f81c1a2a4b3b40b79eda"
"aa8b15285aaf42e0aabf7fcba894e584"
"dd233b5f3d1d3b0289618cc714078f"

More will be added soon. Currently, the parser takes ~3 hours to scrape the entire
catalog for the Fall 2016 semester due to the token throttling.
