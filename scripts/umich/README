TO-DOs
----------
 - umich_evals is WIP. Looking into how to get course evaluations. AFAIK umich does not 
maintain a central public repository with the evals and the API being used for course
parsing does not have evals integrated

 - Obtaining more API access tokens from students to get around the API throttling (see NOTES below)

 - Deal with 9 different section types
 	--> currently overloading the 3 types in the model 
 - Some courses don't have full course names in the API response - needs to be addressed without
 having to manually go through all of the courses and changing the names

 - Some descriptions are empty
----------
NOTES
----------
Umich has an API that can be accessed with a token provided only to enrolled students
Requests from each token is throttled to no more than 60 per minute. Multiple tokens
from current students are being used to get around this issue. Tokens listed below:

"6e15388418fa2483841755f5e2d5eba"
"5562e94b39dccc2eaaab181e0c4ee"
"c03cae2d767ab4c525d1ce5b57a965"
"dfccf802a589fcbdbfa6b4e906e1bb6"
"b0555cfc4e7f81c1a2a4b3b40b79eda"

More will be added soon. Currently, the parser takes ~3 hours to scrape the entire
catalog for the Fall 2016 semester due to the token throttling.

Use one of the tokens above in the "Access Token" field to use the API console
