      "[Formerly AMER 100W] An interdisciplinary approach to American culture, character, and life. Repeat credit for students who have completed 1002. [3] (US)\nNotes: Social dance will be the focal point for our study of American history. Dance offers a window into history and ways to understand issues related to race, gender, and class. Adopting a chronological approach, we will set about to answer a range of questions. For instance, how do specific dance crazes reveal responses to political and cultural events and anxieties? How do immigrants preserve their culture through dance? What does opposition to dance over the centuries say about religious beliefs and sexual mores? Because dance is best understood by dancing, we will have occasion in class to try out a number of dances. Although you will not be graded on your dancing, you must attend these sessions and be willing to embrace the activity (and one another!)",

[4]\nNotes: This course examines the production of urban space (processes of urbanization), the ways that different groups experience the city, and how both of these are articulated with issues of social justice. Central to this task is developing an understanding of how space and place are dynamically constituted by, and affect, spatial (political-economic and cultural) projects of different coalitions of actors that are comprised of globally `stretched out social relations\u00bf (Doreen Massey). In addition to developing theoretical approaches to the city, the course will provide multiple opportunities for application of the material by examining the significance of different places in Nashville for issues of social and environmental justice. Class participants will have an opportunity to develop publishable entries for \"A People's Guide To Nashville\", a book project that will identify, analyze, and bring to light the importance of space and place for creating a better world. Through both theoretical and applied class activities the course concludes with a section on putting forth more just futures for the city and examines the role of utopian thought for guiding these visions.",
