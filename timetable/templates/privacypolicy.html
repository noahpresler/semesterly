<p><strong>SEMESTER.LY PRIVACY POLICY</strong></p>
<p>March 30, 2017</p>

<h1 id="purpose-scope-consent"><strong><em>Purpose | Scope | Consent</em></strong></h1>
<p><strong>Semester.ly is a social and collaborative course scheduling platform for University students across North America. Since its inception, our platform has</strong> <strong>evolved to offer students a one stop shop for course discovery, schedule creation and social planning - reducing student stress infinitely.</strong></p>
<p><strong>The all-inclusive scheduler includes features such as advanced search settings based on major requirements, department and</strong> <strong>time. Additionally, students can view the university’s official course ratings, as well as their peer’s course-granular emoji ratings.</strong></p>
<p><strong>Students are able to create, name, and save multiple timetables, and share</strong> <strong>these timetables via URL or</strong> <strong>Facebook/Google. They can also view which</strong> <strong>courses Facebook/Google friends are considering or have previously taken - a great way for freshman to make</strong> <strong>new friends and for all students to make lasting connections!</strong></p>
<p><strong>We (“Semester.ly,” “we,” “us,” or “our”) have developed this privacy policy (the “Privacy Policy”) to demonstrate our commitment to protecting your privacy and we encourage you to read it carefully.</strong></p>
<p><strong>The Privacy Policy is intended to describe for you, as an individual who is (1) a visitor, user or customer of a website or web presence owned or operated by Semester.ly, and/or (2) a user of the Semester.ly secure platform and communications service (collectively, the “Service”), the information we collect, how that information may be used, with whom it may be shared, and your choices about such uses and disclosures.</strong></p>
<p><strong>By visiting the Site or using the Service, you are consenting to the practices described in this Privacy Policy.</strong></p>
<h1 id="information-we-collect-about-you"><strong><em>Information We Collect About You</em></strong></h1>
<p>We use various technologies to collect information from your computer or other internet access device related to your use of the Service.</p>
<p>Our website (https://semester.ly) captures e‑mail addresses, mobile phone numbers, and other log‑in information from visitors who opt‑in by providing their email address, mobile phone numbers and/or log‑in information. It also captures non‑personally‑identifiable information for purposes of analytics that assess visitor trends, such as numbers of users, pages visited, and IP address country of origin.</p>
<p>Our encrypted invite system website (https://semester.ly) captures user IP addresses to prevent misuse of our system and to enforce sender‑specified message restrictions. It also collects user and device information for, among other things, authentication and system integrity. In addition, we collect date/time information and recipient service links (<em>e.g.</em>, user identifier associated with a particular type of application). For purposes of facilitating the transmission of user messages on the Service, Semester.ly will rely on specific contact information that users provide (<em>e.g.</em>, an e‑mail address for a message recipient). Semester.ly does not collect any other information from users’ contact lists or devices.</p>
<p>Our platform (https://semester.ly) collects additional information necessary to provide the Semester.ly service. This information include IP addresses to prevent misuse of our system and to enforce sender‑specified message restrictions. It also includes user‑specific device information and, if the user opts in, may collect the email addresses, SMS addresses, and/or Facebook/Google accounts associated with the user’s Semester.ly account.</p>
<p><strong>Layer 2</strong></p>
<p>We use google analytics to collect basic, anonymous information about our users for aggregate analysis, traffic monitoring, and growth metrics. (Information about Google Analytics usage of data and privacy policies can be found here).</p>
<h4 id="non-registered-logged-out-users"><strong>Non-Registered &amp; Logged Out Users</strong></h4>
<p>Outside of the use of Google Analytics, for non-registered/logged out users we exclusively collect completely anonymous data.</p>
<p>1. When a user in this category creates a schedule or executes a search we log this information. We simply log that it occurred, when it occurred, and what results/courses were returned/added. There is <em>no link to the user</em>, no information like IP address or cookies are attached to these logs.</p>
<p><em>2.</em> <em>In the future</em>, we will add other trivial logs <em>anonymous</em> for analytics purposes.</p>
<p>3. When a user creates a timetable or sets certain preferences (e.g. conflicts allowed in schedule) we store this information locally on the user’s browser. It remains on their device exclusively so that it can be loaded when they return to the site.</p>
<p>4. We use cookies to understand and save user’s preferences for future visits.</p>
<h4 id="registered-logged-in-user-no-permissions"><strong>Registered &amp; Logged in User – No Permissions</strong></h4>
<p>When a user is logged in (and therefore registered), but has not enabled any permissions we store the following information about the student (some info drawn from Facebook/Google API which the user has logged in with and approved):</p>
<p>1. Name (Facebook/Google API)</p>
<p>2. Email (Facebook/Google API)</p>
<p>3. Gender (Facebook/Google API)</p>
<p>4. Class Year</p>
<p>5. Major</p>
<p>6. Profile Picture (Facebook/Google API)</p>
<p>7. The school they are using Semester.ly with</p>
<p>If a user creates a timetable/schedule we store that (including courses, name, semester, time last updated) and link that to the user.</p>
<p>If a user reviews a course with an emoji, we store that information as well. It is never displayed to any other user.</p>
<p>If a user enables notifications, we store an encrypted token from Google/Firebase Cloud Messaging in order to send these push messages.</p>
<p>No user data is ever shared to any other user in this state. Only the logged in user can view their information/reviews, change their settings, and access their timetables.</p>
<p>We maintain the capability to view the user’s list of friends through the Facebook/Google API</p>
<h4 id="registered-logged-in-user-social-course-permission-enabled"><strong>Registered &amp; Logged in User – Social Course Permission Enabled</strong></h4>
<p>In this state, the user has all that the previous state does with additional features/exposures of data.</p>
<p>Users with social course permission enabled can see which of their Facebook or Google+ friends are in the courses indicated through use of the Semester.ly platform, and in return friends can see that they are in the course as well. <em>This feature works only for Facebook</em>/Google <em>Friends</em> – if the two students are not officially friends according to the Facebook/Google official API, this relationship is not exposed.</p>
<p>The exact time a user is taking the course is not exposed – only that they are taking the course.</p>
<p>The user’s social graph is never exposed in any other form to any other user.</p>
<h4 id="registered-logged-in-user-social-course-social-sections-permission-enabled"><strong>Registered &amp; Logged in User – Social Course &amp; Social Sections Permission Enabled</strong></h4>
<p>Users with this additional “Social Sections” permission can see not only which courses their friends are taking but what times (called sections) they are taking them. By enabling this, they expose the same information about themselves to their Facebook/Google friends.</p>
<h4 id="registered-logged-in-user-fully-public-permissions"><strong>Registered &amp; Logged in User – Fully Public Permissions</strong></h4>
<p>In this case a user let’s any other Semester.ly user at their school see their courses and sections. This requires that all previous stated permissions be enabled.</p>
<p>Users in this state can see other users in the same state which are taking similar course loads and can then connect, communicate, and collaborate.</p>
<p>The only information exposed is the courses and course sections these users are taking and links to their <em>public facing</em> Facebook/Google profiles as shown below.</p>
<p><strong>Google Connected Users – Opt-in Calendar Usage</strong></p>
<p>Google connected users provide Semester.ly with access to their Google Calendars via the Google Calendar API. When opted for, Semester.ly can and may create new calendars and events for the user representing information the user has entered via the Semester.ly application.</p>
<p>If the user opts in, Semester.ly can and may use the previously stated Google Calendar API to access information about the user’s daily free/busy intervals. No event names are ever shared with other users. Free/busy information alone will be shared only with the user’s explicit permission to other users who the calendar owner has explicitly indicated, chosen, or shared the link with.</p>
<p>Semester.ly may use the user’s google calendar information for internal analytics but no information will be shared with any other user or third party without explicit permission</p>

<h1 id="how-we-use-information-we-collect-about-you"><strong><em>How We Use Information We Collect About You</em></strong></h1>
<p>The information collected from our website will be used for standard, non‑invasive, non‑personally‑identifiable visitor trend analytics, simply to help us measure how users interact with our website content.</p>
<p>With regard to the Semester.ly app/SaaS, the Service’s end‑to‑end encryption prevents us from accessing user‑specific content.</p>
<p><strong>Layer 2</strong></p>
<p>As noted above, we capture user IP addresses to prevent misuse of our system and to enforce sender‑specified message restrictions, and user and device information for, among other things, authentication and system integrity.</p>

<h1 id="sharing-information-collected-about-you"><strong><em>Sharing Information Collected About You</em></strong></h1>
<p>Website opt‑in e‑mail capture is the only type of information that could be shared with third parties for internal marketing purposes. Platform service links will only be used (outside of the Service operation) to inform of service failures, emergencies, verification of account changes (such as new devices or password changes), or similar purposes.</p>
<p><strong>Layer 2</strong></p>
<p>Semester.ly is deeply committed to protecting your personal information. To the extent we disclose personal information to a third party, they may have their own privacy policies which describe how they use and disclose personal information. Those policies will govern use, handling and disclosure of your personal information once we have shared it with those third parties as described in this Privacy Policy.</p>
<p>We do not sell, trade, or otherwise transfer to outside parties your personally identifiable information unless we provide users with advance notice. This does not include website hosting partners and other parties who assist us in operating our website, conducting our business, or serving our users, so long as those parties agree to keep this information confidential. We may also release information when it’s release is appropriate to comply with the law, enforce our site policies, or protect ours or others’ rights, property or safety.</p>
<p>We may also disclose your information in response to a subpoena or similar investigative demand, a court order, or a request for cooperation from law enforcement or other government agency; to establish or exercise our legal rights; to defend against legal claims; or as otherwise required by law. Any information shared in such a case would be shared in the format in which Semester.ly maintains it (<em>e.g.</em>, end‑to‑end encrypted content, which would require an end user’s device to decrypt). However, only content is encrypted, whereas metadata, which might also need to be disclosed, is not. In such cases, we may raise or waive any legal objection or right available to us, in our sole discretion. We may also disclose your information when we believe it is appropriate in connection with efforts to investigate, prevent, report or take other action regarding illegal activity, suspected fraud or other wrongdoing; to protect and defend the rights, property or safety of you, Semester.ly, our employees, or the public; to comply with applicable law or cooperate with law enforcement; or to enforce our terms and conditions or other agreements or policies. Likewise, we may disclose your information in connection with a substantial corporate transaction, such as a merger, consolidation, or asset sale, or in the unlikely event of bankruptcy.</p>

<h1 id="thirdparty-websites-and-integrations"><strong><em>Third‑Party Websites and Integrations</em></strong></h1>
<p>All third‑party integrations (including, but not limited to, social media) are subject to privacy and security vulnerabilities. Content sent through such services (<em>i.e.</em>, “out of band” from the Semester.ly service) is frequently insecure.</p>
<p><strong>Layer 2</strong></p>
<p>There may be places on the Service where you may click on a link to access other websites or services that do not operate under this Privacy Policy. In addition, you may be logged into a third party website, such as a payment processing site or social media site, while using the Service. These third‑party websites may independently solicit and collect information, including personal information, from you and, in some instances, provide us with information about your activities on those websites. We recommend that you consult the privacy statements of all third‑party websites you visit by clicking on the “privacy” link typically located at the bottom of the webpage you are visiting.</p>

<h1 id="choices-you-have-about-collection-and-use-of-your-information"><strong><em>Choices You Have About Collection And Use Of Your Information</em></strong></h1>
<p>You can choose not to provide us with certain information, but that may result in you being unable to use certain features of the Service because such information may be required in order to validate your identity, utilize the Service, or to contact us for information. Further you can choose certain levels of permission, as discussed above.</p>
<p><strong>Layer 2</strong></p>
<p>All non‑authentication or network communication use of our Service is opt‑in. The system at launch begins as “anonymous”. As users add in service links, they must confirm that they want the service being added to their account by visiting a link e‑mailed or texted to them (Facebook or Google are OAuth presentations).</p>
<p>When you contact us through the Service, your account will be set up to receive e‑mail messages unless you indicate that you do not wish to receive e‑mails. At any time, you can choose to stop receiving such e‑mails by following the instructions found in the e‑mails.</p>
<p>All facets of the Service are opt‑in and users are free to annihilate any of their data stored by our system, except for access logs, which will be purged periodically.</p>
<p><strong>Layer 1</strong></p>
<h1 id="protection-of-personal-information"><strong><em>Protection of Personal Information</em></strong></h1>
<p>We take appropriate security measures to help safeguard your personal information from unauthorized access and disclosure.</p>
<p><strong>Layer 2</strong></p>
<p>We want you to feel confident using the Service; however, no system can guarantee absolute security. Therefore, it is important for you to protect against unauthorized access to your password and to your computer or other internet access device. In addition, it is recommended that you do not send personal health or other sensitive information to Semester.ly or anyone else using unsecured means. Should you choose to supply confidential information in this manner, you do so at your own risk.</p>
<p>Although we take steps to secure your information, we do not guarantee the security of your information, and you should not expect that your personal information, searches, or other communications will always remain secure. Please refer to the Federal Trade Commission’s website at http://www.consumer.ftc.gov for information about how to protect yourself against identity theft.</p>

<h1 id="no-collection-of-information-from-children"><strong><em>No Collection of Information from Children</em></strong></h1>
<p>The Service is intended for use by adults only. Semester.ly does not solicit or knowingly collect any information from visitors under 18 years of age. Please do not use the Service if you are not yet 18.</p>

<h1 id="use-of-the-service-while-traveling"><strong><em>Use of the Service While Traveling</em></strong></h1>
<p>This Privacy Policy is intended to cover collection of information via the Service from residents of the United States and Canada (collectively, the “Intended Countries”). If you are using the Service from outside the Intended Countries, please be aware that your information may be transferred to, stored, and processed in the United States where our servers are located and our central database is operated. By using the Service, you understand that your information may be transferred to our facilities and those third parties with whom we share it as described in this privacy policy.</p>

<h1 id="no-rights-of-third-parties"><strong><em>No Rights of Third Parties</em></strong></h1>
<p>This Privacy Policy does not create rights enforceable by third parties or require disclosure of any personal information relating to users.</p>

<h1 id="changes-to-this-privacy-policy"><strong><em>Changes to This Privacy Policy</em></strong></h1>
<p>We will occasionally update this Privacy Policy to reflect changes in our practices and services. When we post changes to this Privacy Policy, we will revise the date at the top of this Privacy Policy.</p>
<p><strong>Layer 2</strong></p>
<p>If we make any material changes in the way we collect, use, and/or share your personal information, we will notify you by sending an e‑mail to the e‑mail address you most recently provided us in your account, profile, or registration (unless we do not have such an e‑mail address), and/or by prominently posting notice of the changes on the Website. We recommend that you check the Website from time to time to inform yourself of any changes in this Privacy Policy or any of our other policies.</p>
<p><strong>Layer 1</strong></p>
<h1 id="how-to-contact-us"><strong><em>How to Contact Us</em></strong></h1>
<p>If you have any questions about this Privacy Policy or our information‑handling practices, or if you would like to request information about our disclosure of personal information to third parties, please contact us by e‑mail at [_______] or postal mail as follows: ATTN: Privacy Administrator, [_______________________].</p>
