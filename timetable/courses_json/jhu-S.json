In successive weeks we examine issues such as: how orchestras have historically been directed; auditoriums illuminated; stage machines used and operas surtitled. Our discussion will be grounded in concrete circumstances at particular venues in locations as diverse as Paris, Bayreuth and New York. Together we will examine some core questions: what did material conventions established at individual venues mean for those who produced and consumed musical works; what was at stake when innovations were introduced, and\u2014above all\u2014how do material conventions established in the past continue to have a hold over musical productions today?", "prerequisites": "", "breadths": "", "id": 7146, "exclusions": "", "sections": ["(01)"], "campus": 1, "name": "Technology/Concert Hall-Opera House"}, {"code": "PY.710.256 ", "description": "Not Available", "prerequisites": "", "breadths": "", "id": 7182, "exclusions": "", "sections": ["(01)", "(02)", "(03)", "(05)", "(06)"], "campus": 1, "name": "Keyboard Studies II"}, {"code": "PY.710.412 ", "description": "Not Available", "prerequisites": "", "breadths": "", "id": 7185, "exclusions": "", "sections": ["(01)"], "campus": 1, "name": "Instrumentation & Arranging"}, {"code": "PY.530.642 ", "description": "Not Available", "prerequisites": "", "breadths": "", "id": 7993, "exclusions": "", "sections": ["(01)"], "campus": 1, "name": "Violoncello Pedagogy"}, {"code": "PY.530.646 ", "description": "Not Available", "prerequisites": "", "breadths": "", "id": 7994, "exclusions": "", "sections": ["(01)"], "campus": 1, "name": "Musical Theatre Survey 2"}, {"code": "PY.710.620 ", "description": "Not Available", "prerequisites": "", "breadths": "", "id": 7196, "exclusions": "", "sections": ["(01)"], "campus": 1, "name": "Song Analysis"}, {"code": "PY.710.623 ", "description": "Not Available", "prerequisites": "", "breadths": "", "id": 7197, "exclusions": "", "sections": ["(01)"], "campus": 1, "name": "Schenkerian Analysis"}, {"code": "PY.710.634 ", "description": "Not Available", "prerequisites": "", "breadths": "", "id": 7202, "exclusions": "", "sections": ["(01)"], "campus": 1, "name": "Baroque Counterpoint"}, {"code": "PY.710.653 ", "description": "The solo and chamber music of J.S.

Methods surveyed include electrophysiological recording techniques such as EEG, ERP, single/multiple unit recording and MEG; functional imaging techniques such as PET and fMRI; and methods that involve lesioning or disrupting neural activity such as cortical stimulation, animal lesion studies, and the study of brain-damaged individuals.

From their perspectives, the capability of being sleepless not only distinguishes humankind from animals but testifies to human awareness in its ceaseless striving for wisdom and truth. Insomnia appears as vigilance, an exalted state of mind well suited for philosophic reflection, intense scrutiny of the world, and sudden inspiration. Yet these moments of sustained productivity are inextricably bound to insomnia\u2019s \u201cdark\u201d side, the fact that sleeplessness tortures the body and exhausts the mind, haunts the weary wakeful and makes him meditate on insomnia. Thus sleeplessness turns into an obsession with the potential to transform thinking into endless introspection, self-absorbed melancholy, if not misanthropic sarcasm.

We will analyze to what extent interpretations of sleeplessness in the humanities differ from those in medical and scientific discourse.

An obvious question that arises is whether all branches of mathematics are axiomatizable, especially fundamental ones, such as arithmetic. In the late nineteenth century, what became known as Peano arithmetic was proposed as an axiomatization. The essential feature of an axiomatization is that, although one might have an infinite number of axioms, as does Peano arithmetic, one must have a decision procedure for determining whether a given proposition is or is not an axiom. In 1931, G\u00f6del proved the astounding result that, not only is Peano arithmetic incomplete in the sense that it does not entail all arithmetic truths, but any attempted axiomatization of arithmetic is incomplete, and thus the set of arithmetic truths must be undecidable. Subsequently, Alfred Tarksi showed the set of arithmetic truths is not even definable. Also, by finding a finitely axiomatizable subtheory of Peano arithmetic, Alonzo Church was able to show that there is not even an effective procedure for determining whether a given sentence is a logical truth. Finally, in his 1931 paper, G\u00f6del was also able to argue that any theory strong enough to express the notion of its own consistency, as he showed Peano arithmetic to be, cannot prove its own consistency unless it is inconsistent. We will cover these and other results that have had a profound effect on the foundations of mathematics. It remains an open question whether so basic a theory as Peano arithmetic is consistent.

Today\u2019s Berlin is a nerve center with strong impulses from Russia, Ukraine, Turkey, Vietnam, India, and other Eastern countries. Through contemporary literature and film, we will explore Berlin\u2019s role in a globalized world: how Berliners resist, embrace, or simply describe the influx of people from Eastern countries; how West-Berliners have re-oriented themselves after the fall of the wall; how the majority adapts to the minorities; and how some migrant authors rework the German language by experimenting with translingual writing. By way of literary and filmic analysis, we will inquire if borders or limits can play a productive role; how the history of the divided city figures in the imaginary of immigrant authors; and how, for example, Turkish-German or Russian-German writers inscribe the tensions between East- and West-Berlin into a larger discourse on global East-West relations.

Are there special challenges posed by genocide to the traditions of visual and literary representation? Where does the Holocaust fit in to the array of concerns that the visual arts and literature express? And where do art and literature fit in to the commemoration of communal tragedy and the working through of individual trauma entailed by thinking about and representing the Holocaust? These questions will guide our consideration of a range of texts \u2014 nonfiction, novels, poetry \u2014 in Yiddish, German, English, French and other languages (including works by Elie Wiesel, Primo Levi, and Isaac Bashevis Singer), as well as films from French documentaries to Hollywood blockbusters (including films by Alain Resnais, Claude Lanzmann, and Quentin Tarantino).

Franz Kafka is regarded as one of the most influential writers of the 20th century. To this day, his lucid and subtle prose continues to intrigue literary critics, writers of fiction, and readers with observations that create a fictive world at once strange and familiar, hopelessly tragic and hilariously comical. The related term \u201ckafkaesque\u201d refers to the unique character of a literary universe that is perceived as both eerie and resistant to any classification. In this course, we will analyze texts by Franz Kafka from a variety of perspectives: as investigations into modern institutions and bureaucracy, law, punishment and family structures. Special emphasis will be given to the exploration of Kafka\u2019s poetic practice, i.e. to the material, rhetorical and performative quality of his writing. In addition to reading a selection of Kafka\u2019s prose and analyzing several film adaptations, we will also discuss some influential commentaries on his work and discuss Kafka\u2019s impact on the conceptualization of modernity. Students will gain an in-depth understanding of Kafka\u2019s oeuvre while developing skills in critical analysis and literary close reading.", "prerequisites": "", "breadths": "", "id": 8881, "exclusions": "", "sections": ["(01)"], "campus": 1, "name": "Kafka and the Kafkaesque"}]
