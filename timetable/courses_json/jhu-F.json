The poem, first published in 1667, is Milton's take on the Judeo-Christian story of the Fall found in the Bible. Paradise Lost does not merely re-tell the biblical account, however. By expanding three chapters of Genesis into a twelve-book epic meant to rival its classical forbears\u2014most importantly Virgil's Aeneid\u2014Milton's poem makes room for new readings of an old story. This course encourages students to find their own new readings of the Genesis story by considering the historical contexts of the poem's production as well as the conversations Paradise Lost continues to provoke to this day. In addition to reading and discussing the poem, students will become familiar with ongoing sites of critical debate, such as the representations of Satan and of Eve. To help negotiate these conversations, students will complete a guided research project that makes use of the materials available through the library's Department of Special Collections, housed in Brody Learning Commons. In addition to early editions of Paradise Lost, this treasure trove of rare books offers a wide variety of materials which may deepen an encounter with Milton's poem, from biblical illustrations to gardening manuals to marriage advice. Students will use the collection to ask questions such as: \"How does Milton's representation of Satan differ from earlier traditions of imagining the devil?\" and \"Does Milton's approach to Eve reinforce or revise conventional ideas about women?\" Sufficient class time will be dedicated to introducing students to Special Collections so as to facilitate their individual work over the course of the semester.", "prerequisites": "", "breadths": "", "id": 4415, "exclusions": "", "sections": ["(01)"], "campus": 1, "name": "Freshman Seminar: Milton's Paradise Lost: Contexts and Conversations"}, {"code": "AS.060.213 ", "description": "Novels have long been classified by the national origin of their author, and, for the most part, the great works of the nineteenth and twentieth centuries take place primarily in one country.

Recently, though, there has been a lot of talk about a new kind of \u201crootless\u201d novel that jumps between many locales around the globe. This course reads some of the prime examples of this genre in relation to its immigrant predecessors, identifying its key formal and thematic attributes (such as perspectival and geographical range, multi-stranded plots, and an acute consciousness of linguistic and generic hybridization).

Yet the academic study of literature tends to sideline or bracket visual images, insisting (often for very good reasons) upon an encounter with texts alone. This course reads works that combine media in order to pose and perhaps answer some basic questions: which aspects of our ingrained critical habits of reading and interpreting literature have to change in order to read images and texts together? How do these distinct representational media complicate or critique each other? How has this relationship changed over time?

Through this framework, his text models the ethical regulation of the body, the aesthetic construction of gender, the politics of national myth-making, and the ongoing processes of colonial violence in which Spenser was himself complicit.

Are we valuable in virtue of having a good will, in virtue of being agents, in virtue of being valuers, or something further?

Does the proposed feature make us valuable because it instantiates a simple value property, making us valuable in ourselves, or simpliciter? We consider whether the notion of value simpliciter is a notion we fully understand, or need. Does the proposed feature make us valuable because it makes us good-for something or someone? Who or what does it make us good-for? Or again, does the proposed feature make us such that we are objects of an appropriate attitude or practical stance? If so, what is the attitude or stance? The third part of the course takes up normative questions about the appropriate mode of responding to human beings. We consider whether it makes sense to say that human beings are \"ends-in-themselves,\" and what it would mean to treat a person as an end-in-itself. We also consider various accounts of respect. A guiding question is whether human beings are the only appropriate objects of respect, or whether we can respect other beings, and even artifacts. The fourth part of the class applies what we have learned so far to related topics: to the question of whether human life or existence is valuable, and conversely, whether death is disvaluable.

Machine learning has made great progress in training classification, regression and recognition systems when \"good\" representations, or features, of input data are available. However, much human effort is spent on designing good features which are usually knowledge-based and engineered by domain experts over years of trial and error. A natural question to ask then is \"Can we automate the learning of useful features from raw data?\" Representation learning algorithms such as principal component analysis aim at discovering better representations of inputs by learning transformations of data that disentangle factors of variation in data while retaining most of the information. The success of such data-driven approaches to feature learning depends not only on how much data we can process but also on how well the features that we learn correlate with the underlying unknown labels (semantic content in the data). This course will focus on scalable machine learning approaches for learning representations from large amounts of unlabeled, multi-modal, and heterogeneous data.

It will then explore the economic structure of emerging markets before reviewing economic growth, business cycles and the linkage between growth and investment returns in emerging economies. The course will then cover the instruments available to investors interested in emerging markets by looking at the capital markets in these economies as well as the alternative investment vehicles that currently exist. The course will then look at the ways in which emerging markets differ from developed markets. Topics covered in this section of the course will include political risk; business culture and practices; economic risk \u2013 specifically currency and inflation risk; legal and regulatory risk; integrity issues (corruption, political connections etc.); and practical challenges that are inherent in many emerging economies (poor infrastructure, management skills and practices etc). The lecture series will conclude with a lecture on current topics in emerging markets before providing students a framework through which investments in emerging markets might be considered. To ensure that students are exposed to the practical application of the theory, lectures throughout the course will include practical examples and grading will include a major practical assignment (including a mock presentation to an investment committee) as well as three case studies.

PPPs address issues with financing, operational capacity, inadequate human capital. The parties to a solution may share powerful motivations to create public value by addressing a particular problem but may not agree on how it should be addressed, by whom, at what risk, and for what incentives.

Over the course of the next 33 years, Iran\u2019s revolutionary theocracy has been at the center of what former national security advisor Zbigniew Brzezinski has described as \u201cthe arc of crisis\u201d that spans North Africa to South Asia. As the heavyweight power in a crucial region, with unique religious and cultural sway, situated at the crux of global energy resources and transportation routes, Iran would inevitably rank high on the American security agenda irrespective of its leadership. That importance is magnified by the persistence of antagonism between Tehran and Washington as well as by the Islamic Republic's contentious role in the region. Once again, Iran once again finds itself in history\u2019s spotlight, thanks to negotiations over Tehran's nuclear ambitions that have yielded the first sign of diplomatic progress in a decade-long impasse. What happens next in Iran\u2019s always compelling narrative will have dramatic repercussions not only for its 70 million citizens, but for its neighbors, the world economy, and American interests in the Middle East. This course is intended to provide a comprehensive understanding the forces shaping Iran\u2019s domestic political evolution and its international relations. The course will examine six key critical junctures in post-revolutionary Iranian history, integrating a discussion of political dynamics, economic forces, and international policies and challenges.
