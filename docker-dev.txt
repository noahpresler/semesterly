Developing Semester.ly on Docker

Steps are below on getting your local development environment running:
* Download and install docker for your environment (Windows/Mac/Linux are supporter): https://www.docker.com/get-started
* Clone this repository
* Create semesterly/local_settings.py as follows:
DEBUG = True

TEMPLATE_DEBUG = DEBUG

DATABASES = {
    'default': {
        'ENGINE': 'django.db.backends.postgresql_psycopg2',
        'NAME': 'postgres', 
        'USER': 'postgres',
        'PASSWORD': '',
        'HOST': 'db',
        'PORT': '5432',
    }
}
* Edit semesterly/dev_credentials.py and add a value for JHU_API_KEY in single quotes like below. You can get this from sis.jhu.edu/api
'JHU_API_KEY': 'xxxxxxxx',
* add entry to your hosts file as follows (This file is in c:\Windows\System32\drivers\etc\hosts or /etc/hosts)
127.0.0.1       sem.ly jhu.sem.ly


Launch terminal or a command window and run:
* docker-compose build
* docker-compose up
You now have semesterly running. If this is the first time, you will want some data.

Getting JHU data for a given term
* In a new terminal run the following
docker ps -q --filter "expose=8000"
(this will give you the id of your container which you will use for commands below. ex: 73f48ab997aa)
docker exec -it id_of_container python manage.py ingest jhu --term Spring --years 2018
docker exec -it id_of_container python manage.py digest jhu
* Open a browser and visit https://jhu.sem.ly and hack away
