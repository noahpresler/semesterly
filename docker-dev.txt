Developing Semester.ly on Docker

Steps are below on getting your local development environment running:
* Download and install docker for your environment (Windows/Mac/Linux are supporter): https://www.docker.com/get-started
* Clone this repository
* Create semesterly/local_settings.py as follows:
DEBUG = True

TEMPLATE_DEBUG = DEBUG

DATABASES = {
    'default': {
        'ENGINE': 'django.db.backends.postgresql_psycopg2',
        'NAME': 'postgres',
        'USER': 'postgres',
        'PASSWORD': '',
        'HOST': 'db',
        'PORT': '5432',
    }
}
* Edit semesterly/dev_credentials.py and add a value for JHU_API_KEY in single quotes like below. You can get this from sis.jhu.edu/api
'JHU_API_KEY': 'xxxxxxxx',
* add entry to your hosts file as follows (This file is in c:\Windows\System32\drivers\etc\hosts or /etc/hosts)
127.0.0.1       sem.ly jhu.sem.ly


Launch terminal or a command window and run:
* docker-compose build
* docker-compose up
You now have semesterly running. If this is the first time, you will want some data.

Getting JHU data for a given term
* In a new terminal run the following
docker exec -it $(docker ps -q -f ancestor=semesterly) /bin/bash
* OR
docker exec -it $(docker ps -q -f ancestor=semesterly) shell

This will put you inside of the shell. Now you can get courses by running these commands:
python manage.py ingest jhu --term Fall --years 2021
python manage.py digest jhu
* Open a browser and visit https://jhu.sem.ly and hack away


To install google chrome for running test inside docker:
First get a shell (same as above docker exec -it...)
Then first run (one time only)
/code/build/install_chrome.sh
To run tests, run:
python manage.py test
