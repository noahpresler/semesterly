<p>There may be places on the Service where you may click on a link to access other websites or services that do not operate under this Privacy Policy. In addition, you may be logged into a third party website, such as a payment processing site or social media site, while using the Service. These third‑party websites may independently solicit and collect information, including personal information, from you and, in some instances, provide us with information about your activities on those websites. We recommend that you consult the privacy statements of all third‑party websites you visit by clicking on the “privacy” link typically located at the bottom of the webpage you are visiting.</p>

Hopkins IT will now host Semester.ly and offer an opt-in connection to users’ Student Information Systems (SIS) accounts. The terms and specifics of this integration are listed in the Privacy Policy under SIS Connected Users. If this integration is not satisfactory, a Delete Account button is offered in the Account Settings portion of the website.</p>
